# La bar project 
https://eazeldon.github.io/la-bar-part-3/


Graduate from Code Institute building this site to practice and grow my skills. The site is fictional.


### Concept

This project is a calling card app for the La Bar restaurant and bar.

### User story 

As a site owner, I want to showcase and market my business, so that potential visitors get an idea of what they can expect from a visit 
to my bar and restaurant.

As a potential visitor, I want to see pictures of the bar and the restaurant and information on what is offered, to
help me decide if I want to go.

As a sponsor of events, I want my events to be shown and remembered, so that future events will attract visitors. 

### Wireframe

I used balsamiq to design my wireframe. I used iPhone, iPad, and MacBook pro views to give myself an idea of what I wanted to achieve in terms 
of what the site visitors will see and how it should be displayed. I’m aware of that when implementing it will not be perfect on all screens and 
operating systems but rather it will be a compromise. My top priority is  Phone screens, followed by tablets and then laptop experience.

### UX Design

The design is intended to be straight forward, simple to navigate and understand, without any confusing elements 
that can distract the visitor from finding and using menu as well as finding the locations.

### Menu bar - top of page

Is in place to give easy access to the main pages of the site.

### "Top" link in footer

The footer contains a link named "Top" to ensure the visitor can with one simple step get back to the beginning of
the page instead having to scroll back to the top.

### About

About is a simple story of how the founders created this restaurant and bar.  

### Contact

Designed to enable the visitor to contact  and email the site admin or a specific person. 

### Menu

Menu is a list of drinks, food, dessert, others, and prices, to
enable the visitors to have a better understand, of what they can order.
 
### Events

Events is a commercial for upcoming parties and product launchings

### Locations

Designed to help visitors find the address of the locations 

### Party Images

Designed to show case the events and parties from different years and their sponsors.


### Map from google

Designed to show where in the world the facilities are located.
The locations are marked with a beach flag. When you click the beach flag there is a pop-up that displays a picture of the location
and the address.

### Code inspiration

From Code Institute, 

### Techniques

I have used html code, style.css, bootstrap and JavaScript.

All images are edited in photoshop
 
### testing

Testing has been made in Cloud 9, Inspect mode. In addition, it has been live tested on MacBook Pro 15” screen, with MacOS ver. 10.14.6 and 
browsers Google Chrome and Safari, iPad mini4 with iOS ver. 12.4 using the Safari browser, iPhone 7 plus with iOS 13.3, iPhone 11 with iOS 13.3.

### Deployment

I use GitHub to deploy my project using the following. Step 1: I created a new remote to GitHub, Step 2: In my environment  I use this command " git status" or "git ls" to check my project. Step 3: I use this command ”git commit -m”Finished my project la bar part-2”.step 4: I use "git add ." command. step 5: I use this command "git push" origin master. step :6 I open my GitHub to check if all my codes are there.

### acknowledgement
